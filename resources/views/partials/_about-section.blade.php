                    <p class="mb0">
                        We believe technology should support thinking, not replace it. Intelligence must be designed before it is automated. Sustainable organizations are built on systems, not personalities. That's why we follow a structured methodology: Audit → Architecture → Roadmap → Build → Enablement.
