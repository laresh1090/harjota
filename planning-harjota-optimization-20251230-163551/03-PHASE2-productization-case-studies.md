**FAQ Development:**

**General Questions:**

Q: What types of organizations does Harjota work with?
A: We work with SMEs, NGOs, and government agencies seeking strategic transformation. Our clients range from organizations with 20 employees to large institutions with 500+ staff. We specialize in helping mission-driven organizations leverage technology and strategy for greater impact.

Q: How long does a typical engagement last?
A: Engagement duration varies by service and organizational complexity. Digital Systems Architecture sprints typically run 6-12 weeks. Strategic planning engagements are often 8-16 weeks. BI dashboard projects range from 4-8 weeks. Retainer advisory relationships are ongoing, with monthly or quarterly review cycles.

Q: What is your pricing structure?
A: We offer project-based pricing and retainer options. Project fees range from $10,000 to $100,000+ depending on scope and complexity. Retainer advisory services start at $3,000/month. We provide customized proposals after an initial discovery consultation to ensure alignment with your budget and objectives.

Q: Do you offer free consultations?
A: Yes, we offer a complimentary 30-minute initial consultation to discuss your challenges and explore if Harjota is the right fit. This no-obligation call helps us understand your needs and allows you to learn about our approach.

Q: What makes Harjota different from other consultancies?
A: Harjota combines deep multi-sector expertise with a practical, implementation-focused approach. We don't just deliver reports—we work alongside your team to implement solutions. Our frameworks are battle-tested across SMEs, NGOs, and government agencies. We measure success by your results, not just our deliverables.

**Service-Specific Questions:**

Q: What is included in a Digital Systems Architecture sprint?
A: Our sprint includes current state assessment, future state architecture design, gap analysis, integration planning, security framework, scalability assessment, and a detailed 12-month implementation roadmap. You receive architecture diagrams, technical specifications, and an executive presentation. Typical timeline is 8-12 weeks.

Q: Can you help us implement the solutions you recommend?
A: Absolutely. While some clients prefer to implement recommendations with their internal teams, we offer implementation support ranging from advisory oversight to full implementation partnership. Many clients start with strategic planning and transition to retainer advisory relationships for ongoing implementation support.

Q: Do you work remotely or on-site?
A: We offer flexible engagement models. Most strategic work is conducted remotely with periodic on-site sessions for workshops and stakeholder interviews. On-site presence can be arranged based on project needs and budget. Our remote collaboration tools ensure seamless communication regardless of location.

**Sector-Specific Questions:**

Q: How do you approach working with NGOs given limited budgets?
A: We understand NGO budget constraints and offer flexible payment terms, phased project approaches, and scaled solutions. Many NGOs start with our BI dashboard service to demonstrate ROI, then expand to strategic planning or systems architecture. We've helped NGOs secure grant funding by providing implementation roadmaps that strengthen proposals.

Q: What experience do you have with government procurement processes?
A: Our team has navigated government procurement requirements across multiple jurisdictions. We can work with RFP processes, multi-stakeholder approval workflows, and compliance requirements. We've successfully delivered projects for municipal, regional, and national government agencies.

Q: How do you help SMEs that don't have dedicated IT teams?
A: We specialize in working with resource-constrained SMEs. Our approach includes building internal capacity, identifying cost-effective technology solutions, and providing ongoing advisory support. We act as an extension of your team, filling expertise gaps without the overhead of full-time hires.

**Process Questions:**

Q: What information do you need to prepare a proposal?
A: After our initial consultation, we typically need: overview of your organization (size, sector, mission), specific challenges you're facing, desired outcomes, timeline expectations, and budget range. A 60-minute discovery call covers these areas and allows us to develop a tailored proposal.

Q: How do you measure success?
A: Success metrics are defined collaboratively at engagement start. Common metrics include: cost savings, revenue growth, process efficiency improvements, system uptime, user adoption rates, and strategic goal achievement. We document baseline metrics and track progress throughout the engagement.

Q: What is your typical client engagement process?
A: 1) Initial consultation (free, 30 min), 2) Discovery session (60-90 min, leads to proposal), 3) Proposal review and contracting, 4) Project kickoff and planning, 5) Execution with regular check-ins, 6) Delivery and review, 7) Post-project support and follow-up. Timeline varies by service.

**Technical Questions:**

Q: What technologies and tools do you work with?
A: We're technology-agnostic and work with your existing stack or recommend solutions based on your needs. Common tools include: Power BI, Tableau (BI); AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (infrastructure); Salesforce, HubSpot (CRM); Microsoft 365, Google Workspace (collaboration); and various industry-specific platforms.

Q: Do you sign NDAs and data security agreements?
A: Yes, we sign mutual NDAs and data security agreements as standard practice. We maintain strict confidentiality, use secure communication channels, and follow data protection best practices (GDPR, HIPAA as applicable). Client data security is a top priority.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**1. Client Participation for Case Studies**

**Risk:** Clients may be unavailable, unwilling, or slow to approve case studies, delaying completion.

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start case study outreach early in Week 1
- Offer incentives (free consultation, service discount)
- Have 5-7 potential case studies identified (complete 3-5)
- Prepare alternative case study candidates
- Set clear timelines and expectations upfront
- Use contracts that include case study participation rights
- Simplify approval process with clear opt-out approach

**Contingency Plan:**
- Use anonymized case studies if client prefers
- Create composite case studies from multiple smaller projects
- Leverage testimonials even if full case study not approved

**2. Scope Creep in UI/UX Development**

**Risk:** Interactive frameworks and animations may require more development time than budgeted.

**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each feature
- Use time-boxed sprints with fixed scope
- Prioritize must-have vs. nice-to-have features
- Conduct early prototyping to validate effort estimates
- Use existing libraries and frameworks where possible
- Regular progress reviews to catch overruns early

**Contingency Plan:**
- Phase advanced features to Phase 3 if needed
- Reduce number of interactive frameworks from 3 to 2
- Simplify animation complexity while maintaining impact
- Allocate contingency hours (10-20% buffer)

**3. Performance Optimization Challenges**

**Risk:** Achieving Lighthouse score >90 may be difficult with rich interactive content.

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Baseline performance metrics early
- Implement optimization incrementally
- Use performance budgets for new features
- Lazy load non-critical interactive elements
- CDN implementation for static assets
- Code splitting and async loading
- Regular performance testing during development

**Contingency Plan:**
- Accept score of 85-89 if functionality trade-offs are significant
- Focus optimization on mobile performance (higher priority)
- Plan Phase 3 optimization sprint if needed

**4. CRM and Email Marketing Integration Issues**

**Risk:** Technical challenges integrating CRM and email platforms with website.

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Select platforms with strong API documentation
- Allocate buffer time for integration testing
- Use native integrations where available
- Engage platform support early if issues arise
- Have backup platform options identified
- Test integrations in staging environment first

**Contingency Plan:**
- Manual data entry temporarily until integration resolved
- Use Zapier or similar iPaaS for quick integration
- Delay automation workflows until integration stable

**5. Resource Availability**

**Risk:** Key team members may have competing priorities or limited availability.

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure resource commitments before Phase 2 start
- Create detailed schedule with dependencies
- Build in 1-2 week buffer for critical path items
- Cross-train team members where possible
- Identify freelance or contractor backup resources
- Front-load critical deliverables

**Contingency Plan:**
- Adjust timeline if critical resources unavailable
- Bring in contractor support for specific tasks
- Reprioritize deliverables based on available resources

**6. Client Data and ROI Documentation Gaps**

**Risk:** Pilot projects may lack complete metrics or documentation for case studies.

**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Conduct thorough project documentation review early
- Interview project teams to capture undocumented insights
- Work with clients to estimate metrics where data not available
- Use before/after qualitative assessments
- Focus case studies on projects with strongest documentation

**Contingency Plan:**
- Use estimated or modeled ROI with clear disclosure
- Emphasize qualitative outcomes over quantitative
- Develop case studies as "implementation stories" vs. pure ROI studies

**7. SEO and Content Quality**

**Risk:** New content may not meet SEO best practices or quality standards.

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keyword research before content creation
- Use content briefs with SEO guidelines
- Editorial review process for all content
- SEO audit before publication
- Use tools like Grammarly, Hemingway for quality
- Client feedback on sector-specific content

**Contingency Plan:**

### Appendix C: ROI Calculation Examples

**Example 1: SME Process Automation**

**Scenario:** Small manufacturing company (50 employees) automated manual order processing.

**Before State:**
- Manual order entry: 30 minutes per order
- Average orders per day: 20
- Labor cost: $25/hour
- Error rate: 5% (requiring rework)
- Daily time spent: 10 hours (30 min × 20 orders)

**After State:**
- Automated order entry: 5 minutes per order
- Error rate: 0.5%
- Daily time saved: 8.3 hours

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Annual labor cost before: 10 hours/day × 250 days × $25/hour = $62,500
Annual labor cost after: 1.7 hours/day × 250 days × $25/hour = $10,625
Annual savings: $51,875

Rework reduction: 5% - 0.5% = 4.5%
Rework savings: 20 orders × 250 days × 4.5% × $25 = $5,625

Total annual savings: $57,500
Project investment: $18,000
Net savings (Year 1): $39,500
ROI: ($57,500 - $18,000) / $18,000 = 219%
Payback period: $18,000 / $57,500 = 3.8 months
```

**Example 2: NGO BI Dashboard Implementation**

**Scenario:** Mid-sized NGO (100 employees) implemented donor and program impact dashboards.

**Before State:**
- Report preparation time: 40 hours/month
- Report creator cost: $40/hour
- Delayed decision-making costs: estimated $2,000/month
- Grant reporting issues: 2 grants at risk per year ($50,000 each)

**After State:**
- Report preparation time: 8 hours/month
- Real-time data access
- No grant reporting issues

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Labor savings: (40 - 8) hours × 12 months × $40/hour = $15,360
Decision-making improvement: $2,000 × 12 months = $24,000
Grant risk mitigation: 2 grants × $50,000 × 100% = $100,000 (one-time)

Year 1 benefits: $15,360 + $24,000 + $100,000 = $139,360
Project investment: $22,000
Net benefit (Year 1): $117,360
ROI: ($139,360 - $22,000) / $22,000 = 533%

Ongoing annual benefits: $15,360 + $24,000 = $39,360
Ongoing ROI (Year 2+): $39,360 / $22,000 = 179%
```
