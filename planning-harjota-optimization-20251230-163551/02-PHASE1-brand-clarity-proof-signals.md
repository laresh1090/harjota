   **"That seems expensive."**
   - Response: "I understand. Let's look at the cost of the current situation. How much time is your team spending on manual reporting? What decisions are delayed by lack of data? When we calculate the value of time saved and better decisions made, most clients see 3-5x ROI within the first year."

   **"We have an IT team that can do this."**
   - Response: "That's great to have internal capacity. What we typically find is IT teams are focused on infrastructure and security, and they don't have bandwidth for strategic data projects. We work collaboratively with IT teams—we bring the institutional expertise and implementation focus, they maintain security and integration standards. Would it help to include your IT lead in a conversation?"

   **"We need to think about it."**
   - Response: "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific aspects do you need to think through? Is it budget, timing, approach? I'm happy to provide more information on any area where you have questions."

   **"Can you do this cheaper?"**
   - Response: "Our pricing reflects the expertise and results we deliver. That said, we have different package tiers. The IDIA Starter package at $15-20K might be a good way to experience our approach with a focused use case. Would that be more aligned with your budget?"

   **"We're not sure about timeline."**
   - Response: "That's okay. We can scope for implementation in phases. What if we start with an IDIA Assessment ($5-8K, 2 weeks) to create a roadmap, and then you can decide timing for implementation phases?"

   **"How do we know this will work?"**
   - Response: "Great question. That's why we start with discovery and assessment—to ensure we understand your specific environment and can deliver results. Here's a case study from [similar organization] where we achieved [specific results]. Would it be helpful to speak with them as a reference?"

- Start outreach in Week 3 to allow time for sales cycle
- Leverage existing network first (warmer leads)
- Reduce pilot pricing if needed to remove financial barrier
- Offer IDIA Assessment as lower-commitment entry point
- Have founder personally involved in all pilot sales

**Contingency:**
- If no pilots sold by Week 5, offer free assessment to 2-3 ideal clients
- Convert existing client projects into case study opportunities (with permission)
- Create hypothetical case studies based on real scenarios (clearly labeled)

---

**Risk 2: Content Production Falls Behind**

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (delays SEO and authority building)

**Mitigation:**
- Batch content creation (write multiple articles in one session)
- Use AI tools for research and first drafts (with heavy editing)
- Repurpose pilot project documentation into articles
- Reduce target from 8 to 6 articles if capacity constrained
- Engage freelance writer for one-time support if needed

**Contingency:**
- Prioritize 4 strongest articles over quantity
- Extend article production into Phase 2
- Focus on LinkedIn posts vs. long-form articles temporarily

---

**Risk 3: Pilot Projects Exceed Timeline/Budget**

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (reduces margins, delays completion)

**Mitigation:**
- Scope pilots conservatively (better to under-promise, over-deliver)
- Use project management framework rigorously
- Track hours weekly against estimates
- Identify scope creep immediately and address
- Limit concurrent pilots to maintain quality and timeline

**Contingency:**
- Absorb overage cost on first pilot (learning investment)
- Negotiate timeline extension with client if needed
- Bring in subcontractor for specific tasks to stay on schedule
- Use learnings to improve scoping for future projects

---

**Risk 4: Founder Bandwidth Overwhelmed**

**Probability:** High
**Impact:** High (everything depends on founder execution)

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize ruthlessly: Pilots > Content > Sales > Everything else
- Use templates and systems to maximize efficiency
- Delegate existing client work to consultant where possible
- Say no to non-essential opportunities during Phase 1
- Build in buffer time in weekly schedule

**Contingency:**
- Extend Phase 1 by 2 weeks if needed
- Reduce pilot target to 2 instead of 3
- Hire part-time content support (VA or freelancer)
- Pause non-essential content (focus on pilots + LinkedIn only)

---

**Risk 5: Messaging Doesn't Resonate**

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium (slows sales, weakens positioning)

**Mitigation:**
- Test messaging in discovery calls, get real-time feedback
- A/B test different LinkedIn post approaches
- Ask trusted advisors/clients to review messaging
- Monitor engagement metrics on content
- Be willing to iterate quickly based on data

**Contingency:**
- Conduct 5-10 informal interviews with ICP members to refine messaging
- Simplify messaging (may be too complex initially)
- Focus on one sector (e.g., higher ed) to sharpen positioning
- Revert to broader messaging temporarily while refining institutional focus

---

**Risk 6: LinkedIn Engagement Remains Low**

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low-Medium (slower authority building, but not critical path)

**Mitigation:**
- Engage actively with others' content (not just posting)
- Share more personal stories and behind-the-scenes content
- Ask questions to prompt engagement
- Experiment with different content formats (polls, carousels, video)
- Post at optimal times (test and refine)

**Contingency:**
- Supplement organic with small LinkedIn ad budget ($500/month)
- Focus on 1:1 outreach over broadcast content
- Prioritize speaking engagements over social media for visibility
- Accept slower growth, focus on quality over quantity of connections

---

**Risk 7: Case Studies Blocked by Client Confidentiality**

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium (reduces proof signals)

**Mitigation:**
- Address case study participation in pilot sales process
- Choose pilot clients with lower confidentiality concerns
- Offer anonymized case studies as alternative
- Emphasize benefits to client (free marketing, industry leadership)
- Build strong relationships to increase willingness to share

**Contingency:**
- Create anonymized case studies ("Mid-sized private university...")
- Focus on testimonials over detailed case studies
- Develop methodology case studies (how we work vs. who we worked with)
- Use public information (if client published about project elsewhere)

---

**Risk 8: Speaking Opportunities Don't Materialize**

**Probability:** Medium-High
**Impact:** Low (nice to have, not critical for Phase 1)

**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach early (Week 5)
- Target lower-barrier opportunities (webinars, podcasts, local events)
- Offer to speak for free to reduce barrier
- Leverage network for warm introductions
- Create compelling speaking topics with clear audience value

**Contingency:**
- Host own webinar (control the venue)
- Create recorded presentation and publish (LinkedIn, YouTube, website)
- Focus on written thought leadership vs. speaking
- Push speaking goal to Phase 2, increase LinkedIn content instead

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is about **foundation and proof**. By the end of Month 2, Harjota will have:

✅ **Clear positioning** as institutional data intelligence specialist
✅ **Validated offering** through pilot projects
✅ **Initial proof signals** in the form of case studies and testimonials
✅ **Sales infrastructure** to sell independently
✅ **Content foundation** demonstrating expertise
✅ **Founder credibility** established through LinkedIn and thought leadership

This creates the platform for Phase 2's scaling activities: more projects, expanded reach, paid acquisition, and strategic partnerships.

**The key to success:** Execute with discipline. Don't try to do everything—focus on the core activities that generate proof signals and validate the business model. Phase 1 is not about scale; it's about proving that the IDIA approach works and that institutions will pay for it.

Stay focused. Execute consistently. Document everything. The foundation you build in these 8 weeks will determine the trajectory of the next 4 months and beyond.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this plan thoroughly
2. Identify any adjustments needed for your specific situation
3. Block calendar for key activities
4. Begin Week 1 activities
5. Set up tracking systems for metrics
6. Commit to weekly status reviews

Let's build Harjota into the institutional data intelligence partner that complex organizations trust and value.
